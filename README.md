# Delhi-House-Price-Prediction
This is my first machine learning project, where I built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices in Delhi, India. The project aims to help users estimate property prices based on various features like location, area, number of bedrooms, etc.

Key Features
Dataset: The dataset contains information about house prices in Delhi, including features like location, area, number of bedrooms, and more.
Model: Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the data to understand trends, correlations, and distributions.
Model Training: Trained a Linear Regression model on the dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics like RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: Used the trained model to predict house prices based on user input.
